    "question": "A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations. Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?",
    "questionType": "multiple-choice",
    "options": [
      "Add the aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.",
      "Create an IAM role in each account and add the role ARNs to the S3 bucket policy.",
      "Configure AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) and add the SSO users to the S3 bucket policy.",
      "Create cross-account IAM roles and assume them from each department account."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key simplifies specifying the Principal element in a resource-based policy. This global key provides an alternative to listing all the account IDs for all AWS accounts in an organization. Instead of listing all accounts that are members of an organization, you can specify the organization ID in the Condition element.",
