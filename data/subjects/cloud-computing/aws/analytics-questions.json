    "question": "A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture. What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?",
    "questionType": "multiple-choice",
    "options": [
      "Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed.",
      "Set up an Amazon EMR cluster and use Apache Spark to analyze the logs.",
      "Load the logs into Amazon RDS and use SQL queries for analysis.",
      "Create an Amazon Elasticsearch cluster and import the logs for analysis."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena at your data stored in S3 and begin using standard SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds.",
