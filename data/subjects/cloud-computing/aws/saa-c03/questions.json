    "question": "A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection. The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity. Which solution meets these requirements",

      }
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.",
    "correctAnswerLetter": null,
    "explanation": "General line: Collect huge amount of the files across multiple continents Conditions: High speed Internet connectivity Task: aggregate the data from all in a single S3 bucket Requirements: as quick as possible, minimize operational complexity Correct answer A: S3 Transfer Acceleration because: - ideally works with objects for long-distance transfer (uses Edge Locations) - can speed up content transfers to and from S3 as much as 50-500% - use cases: mobile & web application uploads and downloads, distributed office transfers, data exchange with trusted partners. Generally for sharing of large data sets between companies, customers can set up special access to their S3 buckets with accelerated uploads to speed data exchanges and the pace of innovation. 2]A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture. What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? ans-Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed. Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena at your data stored in Amazon S3 and begin using standard SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. 3]A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations. Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead? ans-. Add the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy. aws:PrincipalOrgID – Simplifies specifying the Principal element in a resource-based policy. This global key provides an alternative to listing all the account IDs for all AWS accounts in an organization. Instead of listing all of the accounts that are members of an organization, you can specify the organization ID in the Condition element. proposes adding the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy. This would limit access to the S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations, as the aws PrincipalOrgID condition key can check if the request is coming from within the organization. 4]An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet. Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3? A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket. - EC2 in VPC - EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet VPC endpoint allows you to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of using the public Internet. With a gateway endpoint, you can access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC, and with no additional cost. However, gateway endpoints do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway. 5]A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time. What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once? C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS Option C, which involves copying the data to Amazon EFS and modifying the application to use Amazon EFS for document storage, is the most appropriate solution to ensure users can see all their documents at once in the duplicated architecture. Amazon EFS provides scalability, availability, and shared access, allowing both EC2 instances to access and synchronize the documents seamlessly. Unlike EBS volumes or snapshots, which cannot be shared in real time across multiple instances and Availability Zones, Amazon EFS allows both EC2 instances to access the same file system simultaneously, ensuring all users see the same set of documents regardless of which instance serves their request. 6]A company uses NFS to store large video files in on-premises network attached storage. Each video file ranges in size from 1 MB to 500 GB. The total storage is 70 TB and is no longer growing. The company decides to migrate the video files to Amazon S3. The company must migrate the video files as soon as possible while using the least possible network bandwidth. Which solution will meet these requirements? B Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3 On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.",

    "question": "A company stores a large volume of image files in an Amazon S3 bucket. The images need to be readily available for the first 180 days. The images are infrequently accessed for the next 180 days. After 360 days, the images need to be archived but must be available instantly upon request. After 5 years, only auditors can access the images. The auditors must be able to retrieve the images within 12 hours. The images cannot be lost during this process. C) Transition the objects to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 180 days, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 360 days, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 5 years. Explanation: S3 Standard-IA (instead of One Zone-IA) ensures high durability across multiple AZs for infrequent access. Glacier Instant Retrieval meets the \"instant availability\" requirement after 360 days, while Glacier Deep Archive is cost-effective for audits after 5 years. (Option A/B use less durable One Zone-IA, and Option D uses slower Glacier Flexible Retrieval, which violates the \"instant\" requirement.) Answer: C) Configure the General Purpose SSD (gp3) EBS volume storage type and provision 15,000 IOPS. gp3 allows independent provisioning of IOPS (unlike gp2) and is more cost-effective than io1 for 15,000 IOPS. Magnetic volumes (Option D) are outdated and cannot meet the performance requirement. ----------------------------------------------------------------------",

A solutions architect is designing an Amazon EMR cluster con guration to support this critical data workload. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? Answer: B) Configure a transient cluster with primary/core nodes on On-Demand Instances and task nodes on Spot Instances. Transient clusters are cost-effective for short workloads. Spot Instances reduce costs for non-critical task nodes. Long-running clusters (Options A/D) are unnecessary for a 6-hour workload. ----------------------------------------------------------------------",

The company designed the application to work with session a nity (sticky sessions) for a better user experience. The application must be available publicly over the internet as an endpoint. A WAF must be applied to the endpoint for additional security. Session a nity (sticky sessions) must be con gured on the endpoint. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.) Answers: C) Create a public ALB + E) Associate a WAF web ACL with the endpoint. ALB supports sticky sessions (unlike NLB/GWLB). WAF provides security. Elastic IPs (Option D) are not scalable. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 656]A company runs a website that stores images of historical events. Website users need the ability to search and view images based on the year that the event in the image occurred. On average, users request each image only once or twice a year. The company wants a highly available solution to store and deliver the images to users. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? Answer: D) Store images in S3 Standard-IA and deliver via static website. Standard-IA is cost-effective for rarely accessed images. Static websites simplify delivery. EBS/EFS (Options A/B) are expensive and lack S3’s durability. ----------------------------------------------------------------------",

The company wants to centralize the management of security group rules to minimize the administrative overhead that updating CIDR ranges requires. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? Answer: B) Create a shared prefix list via AWS RAM and reference it in security groups. Prefix lists centralize CIDR management. AWS RAM enables cross-account sharing. Firewall Manager (Option D) is overkill for CIDR updates. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 658]A company uses an on-premises network-attached storage (NAS) system to provide le shares to its high performance computing (HPC) workloads.
